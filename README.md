# Assignment-2

This repository contains my second Python assignment, where I practiced using **conditional statements** and **loops** to solve basic programming problems.

## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

**File:** `Task1.py`

In this program, I ask the user to enter a number and then check whether it is even or odd using the modulus operator (`%`).

### How it works:
1. I take an integer input from the user.
2. I check if the number is divisible by 2.
3. If it is, I print that the number is even; otherwise, I print that it is odd.




## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

**File:** `Task2.py`

In this program, I use a `for` loop to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and 50.

### How it works:
1. I initialize a variable `sum` to 0.
2. I loop through numbers from 1 to 50.
3. In each iteration, I add the current number to `sum`.
4. Finally, I print the total sum.
